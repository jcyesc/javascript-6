    <h1>Nested Functions and Closures</h1>
    <pre>
      You can nest a function within a function. The nested (inner) function is private to its
      containing (outer) function. It also forms a closure. A closure is an expression (typically
      a function) that can have free variables together with an environment that binds those
      variables (that "closes" the expression).

      To summarize:
      
        - The inner function can be accessed only from statements in the outer function.
        - The inner function forms a closure: the inner function can use the arguments and variables
          of the outer function, while the outer function cannot use the arguments and variables of
          the inner function.

    <script type="text/javascript">
	    function outside(x) {
	    	console.info("outside");
	      function inside(y) {
	    	  console.info("inside");
          return x + y;
	    	}
	    	return inside;
	    }
	    fn_inside = outside(3); // Think of it like: give me a function that adds 3 to whatever you give it
	    result = fn_inside(5); // returns 8
	    console.info("Result :" + result);
	    result1 = outside(3)(5); // returns 8
	    console.info("Result :" + result);
